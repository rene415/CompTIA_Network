A hub is a repeater - it duplicates the data it recieves and sends it to all devices

everyone get an example of that frame
the frame payload does not identify the destination
how to address this?
    MAC address (Media Access Control Adddress) - it is the physical Address

ipconfig /all
    all information on the network cards

40-8D-5C-1C-5A-50 -> 48 bit address each heaxadecimal char represents a value
    there are 12, each char represents 4 binary chars
    total 48 bit -> 12 hexa chars * 4 binary chars

(40-8D-5C) first 3 nums represent the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) - those are issued to a specific company
(1C-5A-50) last 3 are burned into the card by the manufactured it was assigned to known as the Unique ID


CRC checks to see if data is valid

Quick review:
    A MAC address is a Unique 48-bit identifier for a NIC
    Frames have a destination and source MAC address
    NIC's use MAC Addresses to decide wheter or not to process a frame
