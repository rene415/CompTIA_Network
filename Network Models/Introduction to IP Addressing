MAC addresses are limited

Logical Addressing - also know as IP addressing

the idea behind a IP address is not fixed, you have to apply an IP address
IP address is 

you have a router that assigns IP  

Frames have an IP packet, that has a incoming IP Address ans well as returning IP Address
default gateway - the connection with the router itself

built into every router is a Routing Table
it knows where to send data

packets do not travel by themselves, always incapsulated in some type of Frames
while the frames change from router to reouter the IP packets never change.

routers look at the IP addresses and know how to handle them.

Quick Review: 
    - An IPV4 Address looks like this:
        - 31.44.12.123
    - An IPV6 looks like this:
        - 2001:0D8B8:FE01::
    - a Router connects multiple local Networks
    - the IP Packet within the frame never changes
