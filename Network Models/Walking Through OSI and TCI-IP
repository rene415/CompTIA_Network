OSI:
    Layer 1 Physcial Layer:
        Hubs - cables.
    Layer 2 Data Link: 
        Network Card - recieve Ethernet Frame
            Check for Mac Address - and store them (if good network card)
            IP packet
    Layer 3 Network:
        deal with IP addresses - big number one - make sure its for me.
        Store the Ip address that it came from
            TCP Segment - ready for my computer
    Layer 4 Transport:
        Assembler and dissasembler of data
        I break data into bit size chunks with Sequencing numbers
            Port numbers with data
    Layer 5 Session:
        Design a server to a client on a remote system
            many applications that are network aware
    Layer 6 Presentation:
        Long time ago
            translated from example: Extended Binary Code Decimal Interchange Code(EBCDIC) - 8bit char encoding
            pretty much dissapeared
    Layer 7 Application:
        built in smarts - Port numbers and keep return Port number 

TCP/IP
    Layer 1 Network Interface (link layer): 
        Network Card - recieve Ethernet Frame
            Check for Mac Address - and store them (if good network card)
            IP packet
    Layer 2 Internet:
        deal with IP addresses - big number one - make sure its for me.
        Store the Ip address that it came from
            TCP Segment - ready for my computer
    Layer 3 Transport:
        Assembler and dissasembler of data
        breaks data into byte size chunks with Sequencing numbers
            Port numbers with data
    Layer 4 Application:
        network aware applications that handle the incoming data
        built in smarts bring data to the right ports
