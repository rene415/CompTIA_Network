port numbers get added

Port numbers are unique to and individual applications that are used all over the internet
example port 80 is used to define a web page

they get added to the frame aswell, the recieveing Port number and the outgoing port number

the first 1024 ports are known as wll known ports

you can have up to 65,535 ports, but the first 1024 are reserved. I can never used those as return ports.

try to remember those port numbers

Port 80 - HTTP
Port 20 & 21 - FTP

I want to make sure all my data comes in correctly
with Transmission Control Protocal (TCP) - is a connection oriented conversation to make sure that data gets to you whole, complete, and in order.

two big pieces of TCP- 
    - Sequencing number, with broken up 25,000 pieces, it assembles them together
    - Acknoledgment Number, confirms to the sender that data was recieved

That is why its called TCP/IP

another protocal called User Datagram Protocol (UDP) - 
    - UDP is cinnectionless -in other words it justs sends data and hopes you are ready for it.

Quick review:
    - Port numbers help direct packet traffic between the source and the destination
    - packets have sequence numbers so the network software can reassemble the file correctly. 
    - TCP is connection-oriented, UDP is conectionless
