Network Interface Card (NIC)
    No two NIC ever share the Same MAC address - Each company needs to contact the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer (IEEE). they burn those MAC addresses into the NICs
    Tradionatily connected to computer
    connected to an interface that connects to a LAN

    MAC addresses are always written in Hexadecimal! <-- intersting fact!

    How do they send data?
        Binary Data - Copper, Radio Signal, fiber
        they are sent in Frames - packets
        visually discrete chunks of 1's and 0's
        Packetized Data - cornering of Networking
    
    Each frame can be up to 1500 bytes 8 bits to the bit.
        thats around 10,000 1's & 0's for one single frame
        frames are long
        Frame is generated in the Network Card
        network card create a frame and destroy the frames - not sent to the other layers
        once taken from sent to another layer

Quick review:
    - Devices on a network send and recieve data in discreet chunks called Frames(or packets)
    - Frames are a maximum of 1500 bytes in size
    - Frames are created and Destroyed inside the NIC
