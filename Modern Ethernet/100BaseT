Goals to achieve:
    - Describe the varies of 100-megabit Ethernet
    - Discuss copper-and fiber-based Gigabit Ethernet
    - Discover and describe Ethernet varieties beyond Gigabit

Why x10 connections? 10mbps -> 100mbps -> 1Gbps -> 10Gbps
The amount of speed that is worth it to invest. by being 10 times faster
always times 10 with 3 execptions.

half duplex vs full duplex
    - radio conversation, that stops the audio coming in,
    - full duplex is that you can listed and talk at the same times

oldest versiom
    100BaseT4
        100mbps
        1024 nodes per hub
        100m
        Cat3
first ethernet to use all 4 pairs

    100BaseTX
        100mbps
        1024 nodes per hub
        100m
        Cat5e
        Two pairs
100BaseFX
    100mbps
    1024nodes per hub
    Multimode optic fiber
    2KM! WOW!

Quick Review:
    - Full-duplex mode allows bothsides of a conversation to occur at the same times
    - 100BaseT(aka 100BaseTX) runs at 100 mbps up to 100 meters
    - 100BaseFX fiber solution runs at 100 mbps up to 2k
