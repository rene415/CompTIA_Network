Loops issue
    bridging loop, when you plug in a switch that is already connected to a switch
    infinite loop of data, and breaks the LAN

STP ready switches do this automatically and it wont let it loop
    this is the way you avoid Loops

Layer 2 attacks, this is a physical connection
Flood gaurd to prevent this, with smart switches
    it detects mac address flooding

Speed mismatch
    no link light
    speed lights show up at different speeds and junk the slow device

Dedicated Highspeed Ports
    if a switch has a gigabit port use that to another switch with 1gb port

Uplink and crossover
    use uplink port if it exist, otherwise use a crossover to connect two switches together

Duplex mismatch
    if you plug into another computer directly it will go for full duplex
    if you want to do that you simple half duplex it

Quick Review:
    - Proper Switch config will avoid bridging Loops
    - Match switch speeds to network to avoid a slowdown due to speed mismatch
    - Most current switches autodetect, eliminating crossover and uplink cable requirements
