 Chapter Goals:
    - Describe how TCP/IP protoco suite works
    - Explain CIDR and subnetting
    - Describe the functions of static and dynamic IP addresses

Internet and Transport Layers!
Protocol suite
    Novell - NetBIOS/NetBEUI
    Apple - AppleTalk
    UNIX - TCP/IP

Internet Layer Protocol (IP)
    works at the internet layer taking data chunks from the transport layer, adding addressing and creating the final IP packet.
    Then IP hands over the IP packet to layer 2.
    - IPV4
    - IPV6
    - ICMP (internet control message protocol)

IP has 14 different fields
    there are 2^8(256 combinatons)
    0-255 

128 - 64 - 32 - 16 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 1


Quick Review:
    - Each computer on a TCP/IP network must have a unique IP address
    - IPv4 addresses are written as four octets, such as 192.168.4.12
    - Each octet represents a binary string; 192 for example is 11000000
