Network ID, identical to all devices
    no computer can have a zero, network id reserved
WHACK "/" - number of ones in a subnet

the subnet mask is only used by the computer - it is never sent out
The default gateway will figure out where to forward the message

we are not changing the IP packet
    - it will send it the default gateway

Quick Review:
    - Each host needs a subnetmask
    - the host uses the subnet mask to know if the destination is on the LAN or remote
    - Each host knows the default gateway so that it can forward traffic to remote networks
