Wiremap
    all wires are punched into the cable
    
Continuity 
    shows all cables connected
Distance
    Time domain Reflectometer(TDR)

Horizontal runs cannot be more than 90meters

OTDR optical domain reflectometer - works the same

crosstalk mesured in db and tests the connections to make sure they are running at the speed that needs to run

Quick review:
    - Understand how to read and interpret the wiremap feature of a cable tester
    - Continity testing will show if the cable has any breaks
    - A time domain reflectometer (TDR) will show the length of the cable and help pinpoint mid-cable breaks
