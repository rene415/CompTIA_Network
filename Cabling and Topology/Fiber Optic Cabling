Fiber optic cable 
    Core that carries the light
    the cladding reflects the light back and forth
    fiber optic jacket that protects it

2 types
    
    2 connectors - multiple mode propagate light, LED
    single mode - laser thinner fiber optic

    color is orange is mostly double
    yellow is single

    Duplex cables
    all types of connectors - on the network exam

    ST eariest types, BNC like, twist in
    SC square connectors
    FC connectors screws in coax
    they are all old

    LC connectors built into one, 
    NTRJ- there are two connectors, real popular connectors

    PC - Physical contact, slightly rouded edges
    UPC - ultra Physical contact, more rounded edges, creates less light loss
    APC - angled Physical contact, and angled, 

    for best preformance you want PC or UPC


Quick Review:
    Multimode cable carry LED signal
    Single mode cable carries laser signals
    For the test be able to recognize the diff types of fiber connectors
