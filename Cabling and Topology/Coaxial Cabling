Coaxial Cable
    dates back to WW2 Copper conductor, cabling, surrounded by insulating material 
    COmmon AXis - COAX 
Different types if Coax types
    RG ratings define the tickness of cable, thickness of conductors, and OHM's
    100 of RG's ratings

    RG58 - 50 OHM's - still discussed
        with BNC connection
            BNC - British Naval Connector or Bayonet Neill-Concelman
    RG-59 - 75 OHM's 
        Ftype Connector
    RG6 - 75OHM's
        thicker than rg59

Quick Review:
    RG Specifies the thickness of the conductors, insulation and shielding
    Coaxical cable has two conductors once center point and a tubular conducting layer
    RG-59 has a 75OHM rating and uses a threaded F-type connector
