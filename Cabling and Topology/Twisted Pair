one type of cableing dominet
Twisted pair
    always in pairs
    twisting allows the signal to propagate further down a piece of copper wire
    it was invented in the late 60's early 70's for telephone system
    for telephone lines but still used to date

    new twisted pair has 4 pairs of cables
    unshielded twisted pair - UTP no metal covering it or aluminum
    careful, dont run next to a motor or a magnet. It will degrade the signal
    Dirt Cheap! :D 

    ther is even some 25 pair UTP! crazy!!

    When its used for networking its usally 4 pairs
    we use a RJ-45 connector
    EIA/TIA 568A or 568B - standards

Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)
    shielded all the way until the other end, it protects is from magnetic fields outside the cableing

Quick Review:
    Modern twisted pair has 4 or more pairs of cable
    UTP cable is unshielded and subject to signal interference from enviormental factors
    568A and 568 B are wiring standards for how the wires are connected to a connector
