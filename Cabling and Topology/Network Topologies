Chapter 2 focuses on 3 main things:
    - How cables and other pieces of hardware connect to one another
    - the most common standerized cable types used in networking
    - learn about IEEE commities that create network technology standards

Topology is the organization of how the 1's and 0's in the form of frame move between hosts.

Bus Topology
    unique single chunk of cable
    if you want to connect "you get on the bus"
    "Drop cable" comes from bus cable
    its obsolete already (not quite yet)

Ring Topology
created by IBM with a technology called Token Ring
    Data traffic moved in a circle from one pc to the next
    it had no end, it would just loop back
    
Star Topology
    used a central box to connect all computers
    fault tolerance - if once cable broke it wouldn't affect all the other computers
    Too complicated and couldn't be adapted by others

Hybrid Topology
    Star Bus Topology - a mixture of running a cable through the ceiling and connect to a centralized hub/Switch
    Star Bus topology is the Number one topolgy used today!


Careful with Physcial Topology vs logical Topology
    Logical topology is the electronic circuit, how the stuff is going to work.
    Physical topology is how its going to physically going to look like if we had them all streched out

Wireless networks
Mesh Topology
    Fully meshed topology - all conections connect to each other
    Partially meshed topology - one not connected

Goals to achieve in this chapter:
    Explain The different types of network Topologies
    Describe the different types of network cabling and connectors
    Describe IEEE network standards

Quick review:
    Starbus Topology is considered a hybrid topology
    when each host is interconnected this is considered a fully meshed topology
    Logical Topology is the electronic cicuit flow of frames.
