Old technologies, they are outdated!!

2 types of network connectors

Serial Ports - oldest IO connectors
    very slow speed
    networks are so old that dont need it, called RS-232
    uses things like request to send, im ready to recieve datam sending data
    DB9- DB25
    D shapped port and it has 9 pins, DB 9
    Db 25 much older

    Parallel Ports - still DB connector for printers but LAntastic Primitive connections for BUS connections
    max speeds of 2Mbps 25 pin female connectors

IEEE they organize the standards 802 committee network standards 802.3 ethernet

rollover/yost cable - on high end switches, no matter what happens its gives me a very low end connections. Factory reset that allows easy access.


Quick Review:
    DB-9 and DB-25 are legacy serial network connections
    Parallel ports are typically used with printers
    A Yost(or rollover) cable is a serial cable used to configure a router of a switch
