Goals of this chapter:
    - Define and describe Ethernet
    - Explain early Ethernet implementations
    - Describe ways to enhance and extend ethernet networks

What is ethernet
    IEEE 802.3 -  Ethernet is a book
    Ethernet never really changes - in the frame
        ethernet lives in mac Addresses
        frames dont change.
    10Base5 - 
        10 - is the speed data transfers
        Base/broad bandwidth - baseband - is cable only carries one type of signal. Broadband carries multiple signals or channels (like tv)
        5 meters, or length the signals travels with out losing data. 

    today is 10BaseT is the household used
        10 mbps- Base over baseband- T twisted pair

Quick Review:
    - Ethernet is defined by the IEEE 802.3 standard
    - The IEEE has defined many versions of Ethernet
    - For the test be able to recognize the ethernet naming syntax
