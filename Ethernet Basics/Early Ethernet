early Ethernet didnt work like it does now

Segmented Ethernet
    - CSMA/CD - carrier sense multiple access collision detection
        Carrier sense, listens if there is a signal
        Terminating resistors to avoid signal return from the end
        Multiple access, all get to interacti with each other
        Collison detection

    10Base2
        - can hold up to 30 devices

Quick review:
    - CSMA/CD - carrier sense multiple access collision detection
    - 10Base5 and 10Base2 require terminating resistors at both ends of a segment(cable)
    - When connecting to a 10Base2 always use a "T" connector
