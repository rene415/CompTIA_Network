Priblems with 10base5/2 if a cable broke all network goes down

IBM created Token Ring
    - they didnt use a Bus
    - they used a box that plugs is
    - Multistation access unit (MSAU)
    - if any of the cables break it will still work
    - proprietary stuff and expensive

10BaseT was born
    they moved the bus hub to a small box
    it used hubs
    cornerstone topology of how all connections started
    10mbps 100 meters no more than 1024 hosts
    with cat 3

Quick Review:
    10BaseT runs at 10mbps over CAT 3 or better UTP
    10BaseT can have up to 1024 nodes per switch
    10BaseT cables runs are a max of 100 meters between the switch and node
