ethernet connection requires some hubs
hubs are retired

Hub vs Switches
    switches are everywhere
    but not hubs
hub
    cant really tell the difference of hub and a switch

    Hubs is a multi port repeater
    computer sends frame and it repeats the signal to all of the plugged in computers

    downside to hub, if its 10baseT hub -max speed is 10 mbps
    CSMA/CD 

    with hubs it can only handle one conversation at the time
    if they both send a signal at the same time its called a collision.
    it throws an electronic dice and it sends you go first if the number is bigger

    ethernet collisions there is a collision

    CSMA - everyone can access the same bus

    CD if all connected together you can hear the collision

A switch looks at MAC address
    it looks at the MAC address and creates a mac table,
    we have a huge advantage
    it redirects frames based on the MAC address, it doesnt make a copy to all
    Huge advantage, its a point to point connection
    they all run at 10mbps

In a broadcast FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
    it makes multiple copies and sends it to all devices
    Collisions don't happen often
    any member that can hear a broadcast they are connected to the same network

Hubs can be convienet as you can listen to all data coming in
    Spying! :D

Quick Review:
    - Switches forward frames based on mac addreses
    - Hubs use CSMa/CD to avoid collisions
    - Switches create and use MAC address table to map ports and host devices
