Crossover cable
    - 2 of the little wires transmit and recieve
    - we switch them
    - its easy to make a cross over

8p8c connector is the offical name
    but who ever calls it that don't have any friends! XD

Quick review:
    - An RJ-45 (aka 8P8C) connector is used to connect most network cards
    - Watch the position of the wire when crimping to follow 568A or 568B standards
    - Staigh-through cables are the most commonly used cable in the networks
